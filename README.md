A very simple Android app that can morse given input through audio, vibration and light flash.
It also has the feature to morse (with vibrate) a SMS you receive if the SMS starts with "morse:",
so you could receive messages without anybody noticing. Of course, nobody can really read/feel
morse this does not have any practical purpose of course :)

It is not considered release-ready, it was just a fun little project. Enjoy
and use at your own risk.
